# Scene Moderator Agent - Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-03
**Status:** Initial Planning

---

## Project Overview

A Claude-powered scene moderator agent that orchestrates multi-character narrative scenes with autonomous character agents. The moderator manages scene flow, coordinates character responses, handles interruptions, injects world events, and produces formatted transcripts.

**This is a scene execution engine** - characters and stories are defined externally by users in their story projects.

## Core Purpose

Enable autonomous execution of narrative scenes where:
- Characters exhibit independent agency through separate AI agents
- Dialog emerges naturally from character interactions
- Scenes run completely hands-off from start to finish
- Output is structured for consumption by downstream AI agents

## Current Phase

    title Development Phases
    Phase 1 : Task API Implementation
           : Claude Code Agent SDK
           : ~$1.50 per scene
           : Prove concept works
    Phase 2 : Direct API Migration
           : Anthropic Messages API
           : ~$0.50 per scene (caching)
           : Optimize costs
           : Character memory
```

**Phase 1: Task API Implementation** ‚Üê We are here
- Using Claude Code Agent SDK
- Task tool for character subagents
- Single-mode, hands-off execution
- Target: Prove concept with 2-3 character scenes
- Expected cost: ~$1-2 per scene

**Future Phase 2: Direct API Migration**
- Anthropic Messages API
- Conversation thread persistence
- Prompt caching for cost optimization
- Swappable via `ICharacterAgent` interface
- Expected cost: ~$0.30-0.50 per scene

## Key Decisions

1. **Characters defined externally** - This is a reusable engine, not a story system
2. **Natural language responses** - Minimal structure, maximum expressiveness
3. **Interruptions by arrival order** - Async = natural chaos
4. **Moderator-driven completion** - AI evaluates scene goals, nudges to closure
5. **Test-first development** - Write tests before implementation

---

## Getting Started

### For Developers
1. Read [Design Principles](core/design-principles.md)
2. Review [AI Guidelines](development/ai-guidelines.md)
3. Start with [Multi-Character Communication](features/multi-character-communication/)
4. Follow [Test Criteria](development/validation/test-criteria.md)

### For AI Agents
1. Load [AI Guidelines](development/ai-guidelines.md) first
2. Reference feature specifications for implementation details
3. Use [Standard Prompts](development/prompts/standard-prompts.md) as templates
4. Create `lessons.md` in feature directories after implementation
